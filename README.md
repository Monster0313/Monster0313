**Hi, I'm Min Feng — a front-end developer.** :sparkles: Learning programing and front-end tech from 2016.  :fire: \
Love open source culture and the friendly community!  :heart_eyes: \
I do believe coding can lead a society, a country, even the whole world to a better future. :earth_africa: \
I was a sociology student, but now I have another sight to see the world, and may the skills can make more people living better!  :heart:

##  :small_orange_diamond: My Value 
I was always thinking about what kind of human being I want to be. 🤔

I understood that the most important thing is not to be any kind of people, but **realize who myself is**. :star2:
