## Min Feng in Taiwan #Monster0313
Hi, I'm Min Feng â€” a junior front-end developer. :sparkles: Learning programing and front-end tech from 2016. Love open source culture and the friendly community!  :heart_eyes:  I do believe coding can lead a society, a country, even the whole world to a better future. :earth_africa: I was a sociology student, but now I have another sight to see the world, and may the skills can make more people living better!  :heart:
